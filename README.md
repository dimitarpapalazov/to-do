# To Do
With this project I want to showcase, improve and learn new technologies.  
A To Do app is fairly simple and expandable, that's why I chose this idea.  
At first, I will implement a MySQL + Express.js + Vue.js stack, inspired by system I designed and developed during my current job. Also I will do it with Cursor to speed up the development.  
In the future, I want to add and experiment with new technologies such as: Pinia, Redis, Docker and everything I can think of. The same will go about the features, I will start with a simple to do list and tasks and add things I think will fit.
